# Vulnerability Assessment Using ML

This project focuses on predicting and prioritizing software vulnerabilities using machine learning models. The goal is to help security teams identify and address critical vulnerabilities before they are exploited. By analyzing historical vulnerability data, this system predicts the likelihood of exploitation and prioritizes vulnerabilities based on their risk levels.

## Features
- Collects and preprocesses vulnerability data.
- Uses classification and regression models to predict vulnerability risks.
- Provides a ranked list of vulnerabilities for proactive management.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Folder where the dataset resides (handled by DVC).
- `src/`: Contains code for the machine learning model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.

## Domain of Work
- The domain of this project lies within cybersecurity, specifically in vulnerability management and predictive analytics.
- The work intersects data science, machine learning (ML), and software engineering, focusing on enhancing the security of software systems by proactively identifying potential vulnerabilities.

## Motivation
- ⁠Proactive Security Measures : The growing number of cyber threats demands a shift from reactive to proactive security measures. Predicting and prioritizing vulnerabilities allows organizations to address critical issues before they become severe.
- ⁠Data-Driven Decision Making : Leveraging historical data and vulnerability reports to inform security decisions enhances the accuracy and efficiency of vulnerability management.
- ⁠Resource Optimization : Organizations often have limited resources to address vulnerabilities. A predictive system helps prioritize those that pose the greatest risk, ensuring optimal use of resources.

## Introduction 
In today's digital landscape, the security of software systems is more critical than ever. With the growing complexity of technology, the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks have increased, making vulnerability management a significant challenge. Traditional methods often focus on reacting to vulnerabilities after they are exploited, which can leave systems exposed and result in costly damage.

This project aims to enhance vulnerability management by using machine learning to predict and prioritize vulnerabilities before they are exploited. The system will identify the most critical vulnerabilities by analyzing historical data and vulnerability reports, enabling organizations to address potential threats proactively. This approach improves security and optimizes resource allocation, ensuring that the most dangerous vulnerabilities are tackled first.
